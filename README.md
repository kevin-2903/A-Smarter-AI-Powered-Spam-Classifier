1. Define the Problem:
   - Clearly state the issue that needs to be resolved. Here, it's determining whether an email is spam or not.

2. Collect and Prepare Data:
   - Compile a sizable dataset of emails with labels. There should be ham emails (not spam) in this dataset as well. The dataset should be as representative and diversified as possible.
   
3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean and preprocess the data. This may include tasks like removing special characters, lowercasing, stemming or lemmatization, and removing stop words.

4. Feature Extraction:
   - Convert the preprocessed text data into numerical features that the AI model can understand. Common techniques include using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

5. Split Data for Training and Testing:
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

6. Select a Model:
   - Choose an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model for the task. Common models for text classification include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or more advanced models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

7. Train the Model:
   - Train the chosen model using the training data. During training, the model learns to map input features (email content) to output labels (spam or non-spam).

8. Evaluate the Model:
   - Use the testing set to evaluate the model's performance. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

9. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters. This may involve techniques like cross-validation to find the best combination of hyperparameters.

10. Handle Imbalance (if needed):
    - If the dataset is highly imbalanced (e.g., a lot more non-spam emails than spam emails), consider techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes.

11. Deploy the Model:
    - Once you're satisfied with the performance, deploy the model into a production environment where it can be used to classify emails in real-time.

12. Monitor and Maintain:
    - Continuously monitor the model's performance in the real-world environment. If the model's performance degrades over time, you may need to retrain it with fresh data.

13. Feedback Loop:
    - Implement a feedback loop where misclassified emails are used to improve the model. This could involve retraining the model with the misclassified samples.

14. Legal and Ethical Considerations:
    - Make sure privacy and data protection laws are followed, and think about the moral ramifications of email classification.
